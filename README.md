About Me
üéì I am a dedicated Software Engineer with a great dedication to continual learning and excellence.
Pursuing my degree at the Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC),
I have distinguished myself in both academic and extracurricular endeavors.

üèÉ As an individual deeply passionate about technology, I also stand out in athletics.
I am part of the UPC track team and secured the fourth place in the Peruvian Sports Federation (FEDP), demonstrating dedication and discipline both on the track and in front of the keyboard.

üèÜ I'm all about getting creative and working with others, which is probably why I snagged the champion title not once,
but twice at the UPC Hackathon. It's this awesome meetup of software and comp-sci students where we get down to building tech that makes a difference.

üß† I'm always on the prowl for new stuff to learn, and I've racked up a bunch of know-how from courses on Udemy.
Now I've got a tool belt packed with PHP, MySQL, the works of HTML & CSS, and some nifty tricks in Node.js, JavaScript, and playing nice with the MVC pattern.
When I'm not coding, you can find me in the world of LEGO Ideas, tossing in my two cents with over 10 proposals. It's like constructing with code, but you get to step on the bricks sometimes!

üß± Committed to lifelong learning, I've expanded my horizons and skill set through specialized courses on platforms such as Udemy. This self-directed education has endowed me with profound knowledge in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Node.js, JavaScript, and the MVC design pattern, among others.


üß† Skills and Expertise:
Programming Languages: PHP, JavaScript
Database Management: MySQL
Web Development: HTML, CSS, MVC pattern
Tools and Platforms: Git, GitHub, LEGO Ideas
Continuing Education: Courses on Udemy in web development and programming
I pride myself on merging my love for software engineering with my passion for sports and innovation. Through this platform, I aim to collaborate, learn, and grow alongside fellow developers and creative minds.
